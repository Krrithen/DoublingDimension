# **Doubling Dimension Analysis Using Cover Trees**

This repository implements two algorithms for computing the **doubling dimension** of graphs using **cover trees**, a hierarchical data structure. The doubling dimension is a measure of the intrinsic dimensionality of a graph and plays a critical role in analyzing graph embeddings, metric space clustering, and scalable algorithms.

- **Algorithm 1**: Adopts an exhaustive, greedy approach to evaluate all nodes for optimal accuracy in computing the doubling dimension. While this method provides precise results, it incurs higher computational overhead.
- **Algorithm 2**: Leverages clustering and targeted center selection to approximate the doubling dimension efficiently. This approach significantly reduces computational time while maintaining near-optimal accuracy.

The repository includes applications on real-world datasets, such as Twitter interaction networks and Facebook ego networks, demonstrating the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. It is particularly useful for graph analysis, metric space embedding, and scalable clustering tasks.
